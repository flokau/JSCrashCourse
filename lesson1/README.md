# JSCrashCourse - lesson 1

1) Create a GitHub account
2) Come up with your very own project idea that you will build throughout the course (you can change this afterwards)
3) Create at least 2 different classes and several instances for these classes for your projects
4) create at least 3 different interactions between said classes
5) Publish your code as an `index.js` file to your GitHub account

## My idea
create a hiking app

### Classes
- Mountains
- Trails
- Huts
- Mountaineers

### Interactions
- mountaineers can hike from one hut to the next
- trails are logged in their log
- mountaineers can have a meal at the hut
- mountains gan list their huts
- mountains can list their trails
- huts can list their trails (start or end there)
